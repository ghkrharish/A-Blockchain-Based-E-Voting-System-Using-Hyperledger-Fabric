# A-Blockchain-Based-E-Voting-System-Using-Hyperledger-Fabric
Overview
This project is a secure, decentralized e-voting system built using:

Hyperledger Fabric for blockchain infrastructure

React.js frontend for a seamless user experience

Node.js/Express.js backend for handling APIs

MongoDB for secure voter metadata storage

IPFS for encrypted ballot storage

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for voter privacy and eligibility verification

The system is designed to ensure voter anonymity, vote integrity, tamper-resistance, and full verifiability.

üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture
Frontend (React.js):

Voter Login (MFA + OTP verification)

Voting Dashboard

Admin Panel for Result Visualization

Backend (Node.js + Express.js):

Secure API communication with frontend

Voter authentication using JWT

OTP generation and validation

Interacts with Hyperledger Fabric Smart Contracts

Blockchain Layer (Hyperledger Fabric):

Stores IPFS hashes for vote verification

Executes Smart Contract (Chaincode) for vote validation

Storage Layer:

MongoDB: Stores voter registration metadata (encrypted)

IPFS: Stores encrypted ballots off-chain

Security Modules:

Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving authentication

HTTPS and token-based session security

‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed

MongoDB installed or MongoDB Atlas account
